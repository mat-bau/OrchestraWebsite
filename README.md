# OrchestraWebsite

Welcome to our repository! 

This project is a collaborative effort between university students living in the same household, known as the **Orchestrakot**. The goal of this repository is to explore and develop small tools that aim to simplify some of the everyday logistical or organizational challenges we face. What might seem like minor annoyances can end up consuming a lot of time and energy â€” so weâ€™re trying to automate what we can!

## First feature: A rehearsal planner

As a music band, we often need to plan rehearsals during some days of the week or even big ones during weekends for bigger concerts. Our first idea was: _could we design a program that solves this kind of **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** for us_, saving both time and mental load?

Eventually, we realized that just finding _a_ solution wasn't always enough, so we transitioned from pure CSP to **Constraint Optimization Problem (COP)** to allow for more flexibility and to model preferences.

We designed several constraints and preferences that reflect the real-life decisions we encounter when planning rehearsals.

### Basic CSP Rules
- No overlapping slots for the same participants, one slot per song
- A rehearsal slot is valid only if all required participants for this song are available.

### Time clustering - greedy clustering (work in progress)
- We try to **group rehearsal slots** within the same day or time window to avoid frustrating schedules like one rehearsal at 8 AM and another at 6 PM.

### Overload management
- We assign penalties to overloaded schedules, e.g., too many hours on a single day.
- This promotes better distribution and overall fairness.

### Preferred hours (feature in progress)
- Because waking up at 8 AM to rehearse isn't exactly anyone's dream, we're working on making the agent favor **rehearsals between 10 AM and 8 PM**.

### Interactive refinement with threshold acceptance
- We make acceptable a threshold number of musicians to be forced to play at a slot, so fater the solver generated the planning we can manually modify our disponibilities by asking kindly the musicians if they can adjust their schedule to fit the slot.

### Ignore deserted slots (not implemented yet)
- If a strong majority of musicians of a song are not there at a slot we are not even considering it like a valid value of the domain.

### Incomplete but optimized solutions
- Sometimes no perfect solution exists, and not every songs are assigned.
- The COP formulation allows us to still suggest the best possible outcome with **soft constraints** and **penalties** (e.g., if one member is missing or if two sessions are too far apart).
- We still need to find a way to make the agent propose a better planning like _if someone was there at this slot we can put largely upgrade the planning_

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/mat-bau/OrchestraWebsite.git>
cd OrchestraWebsite
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r CSP_Planning/requirements.txt
```

### Execution

#### 1. Backend
Launch the CSP solver.

```bash
python3 CSP_Planning/backend/back.py # MacOS
```

#### 2. Frontend
Serve the static interface
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

#### 3. Access the interface at http://localhost:8000/front.html.
